# EyeRIS White Paper (work in progress)

**Date**

**Abstract**: The EyeRIS software provides a novel approach for securing a network capable of running smart contracts and dApps through the use of a new consensus algorithm: PoUTR (Proof of User Tick Rate). This algorithm uses real time online videogame server connections from the player side to cryptographically secure transactions between network participants. The resulting effect is that no additional network security infrastructure is needed as players can secure transactions passively through their activity, the architecture allows for almost instant decentralization from deployment given the nature of the algorithm and the amount of online players at any given time, user fees are significantly reduced as a result of the distributed nodes and competition for fees, and geographical decentralization is possible, also enabling fast deployment of dApps at a global scale.

## Context

The first distributed ledger protocol was released in 2008 in the form of Bitcoin, using a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm where nodes in the network (the "miners") must solve computational problems and rewarded with bitcoins. As bitcoin development and adoption increased over the years, other developers have attempted to improve on the technology in order to increase the scalability, enable a wider range of applications and services on an underlying blockchain, and prevent centralization. The existing bitcoin blockchain is limited in the applications it can run in the present moment, it can be subject to costly fees, and the type of PoW algorithm it uses has lead to the centralization of its network securing infrastructure, both economically and geographically, preventing far-reaching adoption.

An additional problem with the bitcoin blockchain and other alternative blockchain networks is the requirement for the dedicated use of computing power and energy in other to ensure network security. A blockchain network which could run from existing computational and energy use would thus be superior from a resource-conserving point of view, an essential point in the scalability of the network to a potentially global user base.

## Consensus Algorithm (PoUTR)

###### Rationale

The decision behind developing a new consensus algorithm based on online gaming connection speeds as a Proof of Stake (PoS) equivalent serves precisely to take advantage of existing infrastructure in order to reduce energy usage and increase the starting levels of decentralization. PoUTR would also prevent the incentive for accumulation from PoS consensus algorithms, improving the gini index of the EyeRIS cryptocurrency.

# EyeRIS White Paper (work in progress)

Date

**Abstract**: The EyeRIS software provides a novel approach for securing a network capable of running smart contracts and dApps through the use of a new algorithm: PoUTR (Proof of User Tick Rate). This algorithm uses real time online videogame server connections from the player side to cryptographically secure transactions between network participants. The resulting effect is that no additional network security infrastructure is needed as players can secure transactions passively through their activity, the architecture allows for almost instant decentralization from deployment given the nature of the algorithm and the amount of online players at any given time, user fees are significantly reduced as a result of the distributed confirmation and competition for fees, and allows geographical decentralization, also enabling fast deployment of dApps at a global scale.
